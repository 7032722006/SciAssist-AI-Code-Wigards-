## Overview

SciAssist AI leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to assist researchers in retrieving, analyzing, and synthesizing data from various sources. Users can input natural language queries and retrieve contextually relevant information from datasets, academic articles, or their own uploaded documents. The tool will not only retrieve information but will also provide insightful summaries and visual representations of the data.

## Features

- **Data Integration**: Seamlessly integrates data from multiple sources, including PDFs, Word documents, CSV files, and more.
- **Natural Language Querying**: Ask questions in plain English and retrieve contextually relevant data from your repository.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Dynamically fetches information from a vector database to provide accurate and up-to-date responses.
- **NLP-Based Answer Generation**: Uses state-of-the-art transformer models (e.g., BERT, GPT) to interpret queries and provide precise answers.
- **Visualization**: Synthesizes results into comprehensive reports and visual formats (graphs, charts).
- **Extensibility**: Future support for querying information from **YouTube videos**, based on the video content.

## Architecture

The project integrates several key technologies:
1. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: For data retrieval and contextual generation.
2. **Vector DB**: FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for efficient similarity searches.
3. **Transformer Models**: BERT, GPT, and similar models for understanding and generating responses.
4. **NLP Pipelines**: Text preprocessing, vectorization, and Named Entity Recognition (NER).
5. **ML Algorithms**: Statistical analysis, clustering, and predictive modeling.

The workflow consists of:
1. Data ingestion (user-provided files or databases).
2. Query processing through NLP models.
3. Retrieval of relevant information from a vectorized database.
4. Synthesis and presentation of results.

## Getting Started

To get started with SciAssist AI, follow these steps to set up your environment and start querying your data.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Virtual environment setup (e.g., `venv`, `conda`)
- Git
- Optional: CUDA-compatible GPU for faster model inference

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SciAssist-AI.git
   cd SciAssist-AI
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash

    python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate   # Linux/MacOS
    # or
    .\env\Scripts\activate    # Windows

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Download pre-trained transformer models (e.g., BERT, GPT):
   ```bash

    python -m transformers-cli download bert-base-uncased

5. Set up FAISS for vector-based document retrieval:
    ```bash

    pip install faiss-cpu   # or faiss-gpu if using CUDA

## **Usage**

  1. Ingest Data: Upload the documents (PDFs, Word files, CSVs) you want to be indexed into the data/ directory.

   Run the Indexing Script:
     ```bash

    python index_data.py

  This script vectorizes the data and stores it in the FAISS index for efficient retrieval.

2. Start the Application: Run the query engine to interact with SciAssist AI via a command-line interface (CLI) or web interface:
   ```bash

    python app.py

3. Query Your Data: Ask questions in natural language, for example:
    ```bash

    What are the key findings from my recent research on neural networks?

  SciAssist AI will return relevant documents and summaries based on the vectorized data.
